Cycling is a growing sport in Singapore and we will continue to work with OCBC Bank to develop and establish an even bigger and better event for all ages and abilities. It is our hope for OCBC Cycle Singapore to become a permanent fixture on the local sporting calendar.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>David Conner, Chief Executive Officer of OCBC Bank, who participated with three OCBC Bank senior management staff as a team in the 40 km Challenge this year said, &ldquo;Judging by the enthusiastic response of participants at OCBC Cycle Singapore 2009, the event was a great way to engage our customers and the community at large. I was delighted with the energy and sense of community among all the participating cyclists. It was particularly encouraging to see the children interact with our Mighty Savers mascots and enjoy cycling with their parents. Bringing children and parents together in family activities is consistent with our family oriented business proposition.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Even though the global economic outlook remains uncertain, we believe that it is our corporate responsibility to give back to the community by continuing our commitment to OCBC Cycle Singapore.  This is definitely an event we will continue to support,&rdquo; he added.</p>\r\n<p>This year&rsquo;s events started and finished at the F1 Pit Building, where cyclists and spectators were treated to a carnival complete with music, live commentary and the OCBC Cycle Singapore Expo.
